### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, we trained a model to navigate a maze purely on its own learning. The maze has a 8x8 and has wall squares, moveable squares and the treasure square (the goal). We trained a model to learn how to play the game by playing against itself using Q-Learning. The agent itself and the map was provided to us by the instructor, my job was to implement Q-Learning to the model. This

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
##### 1. Problem-Solving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main job of computer scientists is to be problem solvers. Solving new and existing problems of our ever-changing world.
##### 2. Data Management
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Scientists often times have to manage large amounts of data. They constantly  need to optimize systems for faster response times. They also can use data to train algorithms and personalize applications.
##### 3. Software Development
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will often times develop software that must be secure, efficient and user-friendly.
##### 4. Automation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, computer scientists will be tasked with the role of automating tasks. This helps companies to reallocate labor and save money

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I should approach a problem first by analyzing the problem and identifying requirements and constraints. Then I can start to plan a solution, for instance by exploring possible algorithms. Then as a computer scientist you need to implement your plan into action which leads into the last step testing. You must ensure your program or algorithm works properly by testing the code, ensuring proper functionality and optimization.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization
As a computer scientist, I have many responsibilities to end users and organizations. Primarily, I must promote proper data privacy by ensuring that user data is collected, stores and used respectfully in accordance to privacy policies. Secondly, I must ensure a system is secure, this plays in part of data privacy. Proper security will protect against foreign threats who aim to infiltrate data. Finally, especially in the Machine Learning field, I should remain transparent on my algorithms. This will limit the chance for bias, which will lead to trouble down the road, both legal and functional.
